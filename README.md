### Vehicle Identification and Tracking Automobile License

# **Introduction to the VITAL**

 VITAL leverages advanced surveillance technology to accurately match car descriptions with license plate information, ensuring efficient and precise identification of suspect vehicles. This system integrates cutting-edge recognition algorithms to provide real-time tracking and analysis, enhancing security and enforcement operations. With VITAL, monitoring and pinpointing targeted vehicles has never been more reliable or effective.

**VITAL** identifies multiple features of the test case automobile, taking 3 major inputs:

1. The description of the car: **Colour & Type**

![colour_car](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/proxy/UOpW12R9kZWRJegloBIb213BbL4FwGUA7gOG8CJ7oR2Su2rTpLXnoQYVEVrxW2e6lg8f6Z1nybDZIRv4XDg)

2. The automobile's licence plate: **Irrespective of country, font or design of number plate**

3. The video footage source file: **Either a Dashcam or CCTV footage**

# **What's the ouput:** User's perspective*

1. Screenshot of the identified vehicle: **Time stamp included**

2. Duration of vehicle captures: **How long the vehicle was captured through the camera**


## Brief about the steps

In the above code, we individually take each file and parse into xml.etree and find the object -> bndbox. Then we extract xmin,xmax,ymin,ymax and saved those values in the dictionary. After we convert it into a pandas data frame and save that into CSV file and save it in project folder as shown below.

## OPTICAL CHARACTER RECOGNITION - OCR

### TESSERACT OCR

![CRConvNet-the-Character-Recognition-Convolutional-Neural-Network-architecture](https://github.com/pvjambur/VITAL_Automobile_Liscence/assets/145439975/3c3ec8c5-4c09-498b-9c5b-599485ab22dd)


Optical character recognition (OCR) software that is used to extract text from the image. Tesseract OCR have a python API and it is open source. Firstly, we will do installation of it. It pretty simple and depend on you OS. You can find manual and files to download for installation here.

### OCR Input: Bounded box around plate

### Python based code: 

```
text = pt.image_to_string(roi)
print(text)
```
### Ouput:

```
WOR SIBK
```
As we can see, the model is'nt very accurate, however its depency on various parameters whould be the most proabable cause of its low effeciency.

# Final Output as a prompt

## When the user provides the ideo file to us, we give them annotated video with the timesstamps as well
