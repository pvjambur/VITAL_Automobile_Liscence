### Vehicle Identification and Tracking Automobile License

# **Introduction to the VITAL**

 VITAL leverages advanced surveillance technology to accurately match car descriptions with license plate information, ensuring efficient and precise identification of suspect vehicles. This system integrates cutting-edge recognition algorithms to provide real-time tracking and analysis, enhancing security and enforcement operations. With VITAL, monitoring and pinpointing targeted vehicles has never been more reliable or effective.

**VITAL** identifies multiple features of the test case automobile, taking 3 major inputs:

1. The description of the car: **Colour & Type**

2. The automobile's licence plate: **Irrespective of country, font or design of number plate**

3. The video footage source file: **Either a Dashcam or CCTV footage**

1. Screenshot of the identified vehicle: **Time stamp included**

2. Duration of vehicle captures: **How long the vehicle was captured through the camera**


## Brief about the steps

In the above code, we individually take each file and parse into xml.etree and find the object -> bndbox. Then we extract xmin,xmax,ymin,ymax and saved those values in the dictionary. After we convert it into a pandas data frame and save that into CSV file and save it in project folder as shown below.
